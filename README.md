# Unique-Song-Fingerprint
Creates unique 3D hypotrochoid animations and HTML objects from scraped Spotify songs. 
Calming songs get blue-green colour, high energy songs get violet-red colour, intermediate energy songs get yellow-orange colour hypotrochoids respectively. 

High quality HTML objects can be found in the corresponding folder. They contain draggable-rotatable models of some hypotrochoids to play around with. 

e.g. Generated Hypotrochoid animation for the song "Spirits" by The Strumbellas (60 fps)
